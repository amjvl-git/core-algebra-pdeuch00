Ball bouncing on a line problem

Open the index.html file in VS Code.  Look at the function on line 33, ballLineDistance.
You need to change this function so it calculates and returns the actual distance between the ball and the line.

Once you have it working you can play around with sliders for A, B, C in the line equation and the bounciness of the ball.
Click on the red box to start the ball from the mouse position, this will reset when the ball leaves the screen.
